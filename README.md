This is an implementation of the skils  learned when experimenting with the 960Grid Repo https://github.com/ahadshafiq/960GridExperiment.
- It is a Static Pages Ruby on Rails app deployed to heroku.
- The purpose of the app is to show a visual representation of my resume for a specific job. 
- It is designed on a custom 960Grid with HTML and CSS. It includes minimal JS. 
- It includes download links to pdf files like resume and cover letter.


This is what it looks like:
